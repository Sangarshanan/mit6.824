### Linearizability vs Serializability

Distributed systems uses serializability as the basic correctness condition for concurrent computations. In this model, a transaction is a thread of control that applies a finite sequence of primitive operations to a set of objects shared with other transactions. A history is serializable if it is equivalent to one in which transactions appear to execute sequentially, i.e., without interleaving. A (partial) precedence order can be defined on non-overlapping pairs of transactions in the obvious way. A history is strictly serializable if the transactionsâ€™ order in the sequential history is compatible with their precedence order

Linearizability can be viewed as a special case of strict serializability where transactions are restricted to consist of a single operation applied to a single object. Nevertheless, this single-operation restriction has far-reaching practical and formal consequences, giving linearizable computations a different flavor from their serializable counterparts. An immediate practical consequence is that concurrency control mechanisms appropriate for serializability are typically inappropriate for linearizability because they introduce unnecessary overhead and place unnecessary restrictions on concurrency

**Serializability is a guarantee about transactions whereas Linearizability is the ability to re-arrange those transactions in a sequential fashion**

All this means that a distributed system with multiple replicas will act and behave like a single system which is great and is also kinda what we mean by **strong consistency** so a system that is Linearizable will be consistent

### Leases

Caching introduces the overhead and complexity of ensuring consistency, reducing some of its performance benefits. In a distributed system, caching must deal with the additional complications of communication and host failures.

Leases are proposed as a time-based mechanism that provides efficient consistent access to cached data in distributed systems

Lease is a contract that gives its holder specified rights to some resource for a limited period. Because it is time-limited, a lease is an alternative to a lock for resource serialization.

- Permission to serve data for some time period
- Wait until lease expires before applying updates
- Depends a lot on well-behaved clocks.

when a client starts a session, the master server issues a session lease to the client, guaranteeing that it won't terminate the session before the lease expires. The server only extends the lease when it receives a KeepAlive RPC from the client. In addition to sending the new lease, the server also uses the KeepAlive reply to transmit cache invalidation. If a faulty client doesn't acknowledge, the server will not issue a new lease and terminate the session with that client. Sometimes replicas also issue a master lease to implement its leader election protocol that's different from the session lease that the master issues to the client.
