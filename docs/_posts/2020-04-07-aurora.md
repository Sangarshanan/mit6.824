### History 

The very first and one of the most successful offerings amazon came up with as AWS EC2 instances which are a bunch of Virtual Machines running an OS connected to a Hard drive and managed by a Virtual Machine Manager at AWS data centers. This was ideal for webservers cause it was easy to quickly spin one up and just spin multiple if we needed to scale, Now databases were also hosted on these EC2 machines but had a caveat. With Webservers being stateless when the VM or disk crashed we could just spin up another one and continue work but with Databases being stateful **disk failures ended could be catastrophic**

This led to periodic snapshots to database and backing it up to S3 where it could be recovered and restored on crash but even then we kinda lose the data in between snapshots

AWS now came up with another offering called **EBS** which is made up of a set of **chain replicated storage volumes** and with this EC2 instances running databases would mount an EBS volume and when shit goes south it can remount it back up again to retain  all the data. So EBS was awesome for managing state but  **EBS volume can only be mounted by one EC2 at a time, its not sharable** also it **amplified the network traffic** cause of the writes to the DB happens on a NFS and on a setup with frequent writes this could be a bottleneck
